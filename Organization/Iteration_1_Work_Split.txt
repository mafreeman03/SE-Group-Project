Work Split for Iteration 1:

When finished with a task, put "COMPLETED" at the end of the line
If you find your task is more difficult/longer than expected and want help, let people know
If you find your task is easier/shorter than expected, let people know and help out elsewhere

By Wednesday 2/11:
  Everyone: Decide which two other fully-dressed use cases you will make and list them below (mark completed when you've finished them all)
    Matt: Check in a Guest, Check out a Guest, Search Reservations
    Duane: Cancel Reservation, 
    Andrew: Login, 
    Emmanuel: Reset Password, 
    Hannah: Book a Reservation, 

By Monday 2/16:
  Everyone: Complete three fully-dressed use cases along with SSDs and Operation Contracts 
              Remember that some use cases may include things in others, e.g., Modify Reservation doesn't have to detail how to search for the reservation since Search Reservations does that
            Add to Trello any tickets for your job (things you need to fix later) and check them off when done
            Help on Presentation when done with your work
  Matt: Complete Use Case Diagram, create PDF Deliverable
  Duane: Create Presentation
  Andrew: Create Website
  Emmanuel: Create Domain Model
  Hannah: Create Wireframe drafts (UI sketches)
